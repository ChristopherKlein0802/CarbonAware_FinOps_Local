        **Carbon-Aware FinOps Dashboard** - Integrated cloud cost and CO‚ÇÇ emissions monitoring

        This dashboard demonstrates how carbon-aware scheduling can reduce both environmental
        impact and operating costs for AWS infrastructure.

        **Purpose**: Research prototype developed for bachelor thesis to prove the feasibility of
        integrated FinOps + carbon tracking for German SMEs.

        **Key Features**:
        - Real-time German grid carbon intensity tracking (ElectricityMaps)
        - CloudTrail-based precision runtime tracking (¬±5% accuracy target)
        - Business case modeling with McKinsey/MIT research-backed scenarios
        - CSRD Scope 2/3 compliance reporting

        **Limitations**:
        - Optimization calculations require empirical validation in production
        - Conservative estimates with ¬±15% uncertainty range (literature-based)
        - Development-scale adjustments for small infrastructures (<‚Ç¨1/month)
