    This tool is a research prototype developed for bachelor thesis purposes. Key considerations:

    - **Optimization calculations** require empirical validation in production environments
    - **Conservative estimates** with ¬±15% uncertainty range (literature-based: McKinsey [7], MIT [20])
    - **Theoretical scenarios** demonstrate methodology feasibility for SME use cases
    - **Development-scale adjustments** applied for small infrastructures (<‚Ç¨1/month)

    For detailed methodology, see [Documentation](https://github.com/your-repo/docs).
