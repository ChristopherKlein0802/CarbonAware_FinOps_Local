## 📊 Expected Outcomes

### Literature Matrix Example
| Paper | Year | Carbon Data | Cost Data | Real-time | Integration | German Focus | Gap Identified |
|-------|------|-------------|-----------|-----------|-------------|--------------|----------------|
| Smith et al. | 2024 | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | No cost integration |
| Jones & Lee | 2023 | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | No carbon awareness |
| **This Research** | 2025 | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | **Complete integration** |

### Positioning Statement (Target)
> "While existing research addresses carbon optimization (Smith et al., 2024) and cost optimization (Jones & Lee, 2023) separately, no previous work has demonstrated an integrated approach using real-time German grid data for SME cloud deployments. This research fills this gap by providing the first tool to combine AWS Cost Explorer data with ElectricityMaps API for unified optimization."
