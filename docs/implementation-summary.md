```
src/pages.py → Complete restructuring (800+ lines added)
├── render_overview_page() → Executive Summary
├── render_carbon_page() → German grid focus
├── render_competitive_analysis_page() → NEW
└── Enhanced visualizations

src/app.py → Navigation updates
├── 5-page structure
├── Updated routing

```

### **💰 Mathematical Scaling Logic**
```python
# Baseline from 4 validated instances
baseline_cost_per_instance = €20.81 / 4 = €5.20
baseline_co2_per_instance = 0.373 kg / 4 = 0.093 kg

# SME projections
for instance_count in [20, 50, 100]:
    projected_cost = €5.20 * instance_count
    projected_savings = projected_cost * 0.32  # 32% integrated optimization
    roi_months = €5000 / projected_savings     # Implementation cost
```

### **🇩🇪 German Grid Integration**
```python
# Real-time status with recommendations
if grid_intensity < 200:
    status = "🟢 OPTIMAL - Run workloads NOW"
elif grid_intensity < 350:
    status = "🟡 MODERATE - Consider delays"
else:
    status = "🔴 HIGH CARBON - Avoid workloads"
```
