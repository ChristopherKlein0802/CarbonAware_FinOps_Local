# 📋 Project Limitations Analysis
## Bachelor Thesis Comprehensive Assessment

---

## 🎯 **METHODOLOGICAL LIMITATIONS**

### 1. **Scale Limitations**
```yaml
Test Environment: 4 AWS instances
Reality Gap: Real SME typically 20-100+ instances

Impact:
├── Statistical significance insufficient for generalizable results
├── Cost optimization patterns may not scale linearly  
├── API rate limiting not tested at production volumes
└── Network effects and interdependencies not captured
```

**Mitigation Strategy**: Monte-Carlo simulation for larger scales (planned)

### 2. **Temporal Limitations**
```yaml
Data Collection: Point-in-time snapshot (September 2025)
Missing Elements:
├── Seasonal carbon intensity variations
├── Long-term cost trends
├── Multi-year ROI validation
└── Business cycle impact assessment
```

**Academic Honesty**: All findings are preliminary, representing Q3 2025 conditions only.

### 3. **Geographic Scope**
```yaml
Focus: German electricity grid (ElectricityMap zone: DE)
Excluded:
├── Other EU regions with different grid compositions
├── Cross-border energy trading effects
├── Regional AWS data center variations
└── Multi-region deployment scenarios
```

---

## 🔧 **TECHNICAL LIMITATIONS**

### 1. **API Dependencies**
```yaml
Critical Dependencies:
├── ElectricityMap API (carbon intensity)
├── AWS Cost Explorer API (billing data)
├── Boavizta API (hardware power consumption)
└── AWS EC2 API (instance metadata)

Failure Points:
├── Any API unavailability = partial/complete data loss
├── API rate limiting at scale
├── Cost implications of frequent API calls
└── No fallback systems (by design - scientific rigor)
```

### 2. **Data Quality Constraints**
```yaml
ElectricityMap:
├── 30-minute cache = potential staleness
├── Free tier limitations
└── Regional accuracy variations

Boavizta:
├── Hardware models may not match exact AWS configurations
├── Power estimates ±10% uncertainty
└── Limited instance type coverage

AWS Cost Explorer:
├── 1-day data delay
├── No resource-level granularity
└── Proportional allocation assumptions
```

### 3. **Infrastructure Assumptions**
```yaml
Scheduling Assumptions:
├── 50% workloads assumed schedulable (may be unrealistic)
├── Office hours pattern (9-17h) assumed universal
├── No consideration for business-critical always-on services
└── Grid timing optimization assumes flexible workload timing

Power Consumption:
├── Static per-instance-type values
├── No consideration for actual CPU utilization
├── Ignores cooling and infrastructure overhead
└── AWS Graviton vs Intel differences not modeled
```

---

## 💼 **BUSINESS MODEL LIMITATIONS**

### 1. **ROI Calculation Constraints**
```yaml
Current Status: 274-1375 months payback for SME scenarios

Problematic Assumptions:
├── €5000 implementation cost estimate unvalidated
├── Optimization percentages from literature, not practice
├── No consideration for implementation complexity
└── SME resource constraints not factored

Reality Check:
├── ROI timeframes exceed typical SME planning horizons
├── Implementation effort likely underestimated  
├── Change management costs ignored
└── Business disruption risks not quantified
```

### 2. **Market Positioning Limitations**
```yaml
Competitive Analysis: Limited to publicly available information

Missing Elements:
├── Deep technical analysis of competing solutions
├── Enterprise-grade tools comparison
├── Custom in-house solutions assessment
└── Vendor roadmaps and future capabilities

Risk: May have overlooked existing similar solutions
```

---

## 🧪 **SCIENTIFIC LIMITATIONS**

### 1. **Statistical Validity**
```yaml
Sample Size: n=4 (test instances)
Statistical Issues:
├── Sample size insufficient for significance testing
├── No control group for optimization claims
├── Cherry-picking bias potential (thesis-tagged instances only)
└── No confidence intervals for key metrics
```

### 2. **Validation Limitations**
```yaml
Current Status: Methodology demonstration only

Missing Validation:
├── No real-world deployment validation
├── No user acceptance testing
├── No long-term effectiveness studies
└── No comparative studies vs existing tools
```

### 3. **Reproducibility Challenges**
```yaml
External Dependencies:
├── API keys required for replication
├── AWS account and billing history needed
├── Specific German grid conditions during testing
└── Time-sensitive carbon intensity data
```

---

## 🎓 **ACADEMIC SCOPE LIMITATIONS**

### 1. **Bachelor Thesis Constraints**
```yaml
Time Limitations:
├── 6-month project duration
├── Single researcher capacity
├── Limited literature review scope
└── No budget for extensive testing

Scope Boundaries:
├── Prototype development only
├── German market focus only
├── SME segment focus only
└── Analysis-first approach (not automation)
```

### 2. **Literature Foundation**
```yaml
Current Status: 15-20 core papers reviewed

Gaps:
├── Limited access to proprietary industry reports
├── Fast-moving field - recent developments may be missed
├── Language bias (English/German sources primarily)
└── Academic vs industry practice gap
```

---

## ⚠️ **RISK ASSESSMENT**

### 1. **High Risk Limitations**
```yaml
Thesis Defense Risks:
├── ROI calculations may be questioned as unrealistic
├── Scale limitations undermine generalizability claims
├── Competitive analysis may miss key players
└── Technical approach may be seen as over-engineered for results
```

### 2. **Medium Risk Limitations**
```yaml
Implementation Risks:
├── API cost scaling at production volumes
├── Real-world scheduling constraints more complex
├── German-only focus limits broader applicability
└── Business adoption barriers not fully addressed
```

### 3. **Mitigation Strategies**
```yaml
Academic Defense:
├── Frame as "exploratory research" not "validation"
├── Emphasize methodology contribution over results
├── Document all assumptions transparently
└── Present as "proof of feasibility" not "proven solution"

Technical Robustness:
├── Implement Monte-Carlo simulations for scaling
├── Add comprehensive error handling
├── Document API dependencies clearly
└── Provide fallback analysis approaches
```

## 📝 **THESIS DEFENSE PREPARATION**

### Expected Questions & Responses

**Q: "Why only 4 instances for SME claims?"**
**A:** "This is a methodology demonstration. The 4 instances validate our API integration and calculation approach. Monte-Carlo simulations extrapolate to realistic SME scales while acknowledging the limitations."

**Q: "ROI of 274+ months seems unrealistic for SMEs?"**
**A:** "Correct - this highlights a key finding. Current small-scale economics don't justify dedicated tooling. This research identifies the minimum viable scale threshold for such solutions."

**Q: "How do you know competitors don't exist?"**
**A:** "Our competitive analysis is preliminary and limited to publicly available information. This represents a potential gap rather than a confirmed unique position."

**Q: "German-only focus limits applicability?"**
**A:** "Acknowledged limitation. German focus provides methodological validation. The approach is transferable to other regions with appropriate data sources."
