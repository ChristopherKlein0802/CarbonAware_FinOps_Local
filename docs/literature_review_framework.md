# Literature Review Framework for Carbon-Aware FinOps

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Research Areas to Address

### **1. Existing FinOps Tools Analysis**
**What to research:**
- AWS Cost Explorer vs CloudHealth vs Cloudability
- What carbon metrics do they provide (if any)?
- Why don't they integrate carbon optimization?

**Academic Value:**
- Positions your tool as "first of its kind"
- Shows gap in existing research/tools
- Justifies your approach scientifically

### **2. Green Computing Research**
**Key papers to reference:**
- "Carbon-Aware Computing" (Google Research, 2021)
- "Green Cloud Computing" (IEEE papers)
- "Sustainable Data Centers" research
- German Energiewende and IT infrastructure studies

**What to analyze:**
- Current state of carbon-aware computing
- Existing methodologies for carbon calculation
- Why your approach is novel/better

### **3. Methodology Validation**
**Scientific backing needed:**
- ElectricityMap API accuracy studies
- Boavizta methodology validation
- AWS Cost Explorer data reliability
- Carbon intensity calculation standards

**Example Implementation:**
```python
def validate_carbon_calculation_methodology():
    """
    Compare our carbon calculations with published research methodologies
    Reference: "A Framework for Carbon Footprint of Cloud Computing" (IEEE 2020)
    """
    # Implementation comparing your method vs academic standards
```

### **4. German Market Specific Research**
**Focus areas:**
- EU Green Deal impact on cloud computing
- German electricity grid studies (Energiewende)
- Corporate sustainability reporting requirements in Germany
- Regional carbon optimization vs global averages

## ðŸ’¡ **How to Implement Academic Rigor**

### **Option 1: Research Integration Module**
```python
# Add to your project:
class LiteratureValidation:
    def compare_with_existing_tools(self):
        """Compare results with AWS Cost Explorer recommendations"""
        
    def validate_carbon_methodology(self):
        """Cross-reference with academic carbon calculation standards"""
        
    def benchmark_against_published_studies(self):
        """Compare optimization results with published case studies"""
```

### **Option 2: Methodology Documentation**
Create detailed documentation explaining:
- Why you chose specific APIs
- How your calculations compare to academic standards  
- Limitations and accuracy assessments
- Validation against published benchmarks
