## üîß Essential Command Details

### üöÄ Getting Started Commands

#### `make setup`
- **Purpose**: Complete project setup for first-time users
- **What it does**: 
  - Creates Python virtual environment
  - Installs all dependencies

- **Example**:
```bash
make setup
```

### üíª Development Commands

#### `make test`
- **Purpose**: Run comprehensive quality checks
- **What it does**:
  - Lints code with flake8
  - Type checks with mypy

  - Security scan with bandit
- **When to use**: Before committing code changes
- **Example**:
```bash
make test
```

#### `make cleanup`
- **Purpose**: Clean temporary files and caches
- **What it does**:
  - Removes Python cache files
  - Cleans pytest cache
  - Removes build artifacts
  - Deletes system files like .DS_Store
- **When to use**: To clean up development environment
- **Example**:
```bash
make cleanup
```

#### `make reset`
- **Purpose**: Complete project reset (nuclear option!)
- **What it does**:
  - Removes virtual environment
  - Cleans all cache files
  - Removes Terraform state
  - Deletes Lambda packages
  - Cleans logs and build artifacts
- **When to use**: When you want to start fresh
- **‚ö†Ô∏è Warning**: This removes everything - use with caution!
- **Example**:
```bash
make reset
# Type 'y' when prompted to confirm
```

### ‚òÅÔ∏è Deployment Commands

#### `make deploy`
- **Purpose**: Deploy complete infrastructure to AWS
- **What it does**:
  1. Initializes Terraform
  2. Builds Lambda packages
  3. Deploys infrastructure
  4. Sets up secrets
- **Prerequisites**: AWS SSO configured and logged in
- **Example**:
```bash
make deploy
```

#### `make destroy`
- **Purpose**: Completely destroy AWS infrastructure
- **What it does**:
  - Shows current resources
  - Uses terraform destroy
  - Cleans orphaned resources
  - Verifies complete cleanup
- **‚ö†Ô∏è Warning**: This permanently deletes ALL AWS resources!
- **Example**:
```bash
make destroy
# Type 'CLEANUP' when prompted to confirm
```

### üèÉ Operations Commands

#### `make run`
- **Purpose**: Run the complete carbon-aware system
- **What it does**:
  1. Triggers Lambda carbon-aware scheduler
  2. Checks Lambda execution results
  3. Shows system status
- **Prerequisites**: Infrastructure must be deployed
- **Example**:
```bash
make run
```

#### `make dashboard`
- **Purpose**: Launch real-time dashboard
- **What it does**: Starts Flask dashboard at http://localhost:8050
- **When to use**: To view real-time metrics and system status
- **Example**:
```bash
make dashboard
# Press Ctrl+C to stop
```

#### `make status`
- **Purpose**: Show comprehensive system status
- **What it displays**:
  - AWS connection status
  - Terraform resource count
  - EC2 instance states
  - Lambda function status
- **Example**:
```bash
make status
```

### üîß Utility Commands

#### `make emergency-stop`
- **Purpose**: Emergency stop all managed instances
- **What it does**: Immediately stops ALL running EC2 instances with the project tag
- **When to use**: Emergency situations to reduce costs
- **‚ö†Ô∏è Warning**: This stops instances immediately!
- **Example**:
```bash
make emergency-stop
# Type 'y' when prompted to confirm
```

#### `make logs`
- **Purpose**: View recent Lambda function logs
- **What it shows**: Recent logs from scheduler Lambda function
- **When to use**: For debugging and monitoring
- **Example**:
```bash
make logs
```

#### `make instances`
- **Purpose**: List all managed EC2 instances
- **What it shows**: Instance ID, type, state, and name in table format
- **When to use**: To check instance status
- **Example**:
```bash
make instances
```

## üìã Common Workflows

### üåü First Time Setup
```bash
# 1. Setup project
make setup

# 2. Deploy infrastructure  
make deploy

# 3. Run the system
make run

# 4. View dashboard
make dashboard
```

### üîÑ Daily Development
```bash
# Run tests before committing
make test

# Clean up temporary files
make cleanup

# Check system status
make status
```

### üö® Emergency Procedures
```bash
# Stop all instances immediately
make emergency-stop

# Check what's running
make instances

# View recent logs
make logs
```

### üßπ Complete Cleanup
```bash
# Destroy AWS infrastructure (saves money)
make destroy

# Reset local project (optional)
make reset
```

## üîß Configuration

The Makefile uses these default configurations:
- **AWS Profile**: `carbon-finops-sandbox`
- **AWS Region**: `eu-central-1`
- **Python**: `python3`
- **Virtual Environment**: `venv/`

To customize, edit the configuration variables at the top of the Makefile:
```makefile
AWS_PROFILE := your-profile-name
AWS_REGION := your-preferred-region
```

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Virtual environment not found**:
```bash
make setup  # Run this first
```

**AWS authentication failed**:
```bash
aws sso login --profile carbon-finops-sandbox
```

**Terraform state locked**:
```bash
# Check for running processes, then try again
make destroy
```

**No instances found**:
```bash
# Deploy infrastructure first
make deploy
```

## üí° Tips

- Always run `make status` to check system health
- Use `make emergency-stop` if you see unexpected costs
- Run `make test` before making changes
- Use `make destroy` to completely clean up AWS resources when done
- Check `make logs` if something isn't working as expected

The streamlined Makefile focuses on essential commands only, making it easier to understand and use the Carbon-Aware FinOps system!
