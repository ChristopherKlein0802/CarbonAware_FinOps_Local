## Project Overview

Integrated monitoring system for cloud costs and CO‚ÇÇ emissions, focused on German SMEs. Combines real-time power grid metrics, AWS runtime data, and FinOps principles using a Design Science Research approach.

**Key Features:**
- üåç **Real-time Carbon Tracking**: ElectricityMaps integration for German power grid
- üí∞ **Cost & Carbon Integration**: Combined tracking instead of separate tools
- üìä **Business Case Calculator**: Savings estimation based on McKinsey/MIT research
- üèõÔ∏è **CSRD-Ready**: Scope 2/3 reporting for German compliance
- ‚ö° **CloudTrail Precision**: Minute-level runtime tracking for accurate calculations

## Research Question

"How can an integrated monitoring system be developed that simultaneously tracks costs and CO‚ÇÇ emissions of cloud infrastructures, and what advantages does this approach offer compared to existing separate solutions?"

## Motivation

84% of companies see cost control as the biggest cloud challenge, while CSRD (from 2024) requires detailed emission reports. German SMEs need to reduce costs and provide reliable emission data, but available tools separate these two dimensions.

## System Architecture

The system follows Clean Architecture principles with clear layer separation:

**Domain Layer** (`src/domain/`)
- Business logic and calculations (CO‚ÇÇ emissions, power consumption)
- Domain services (runtime, carbon data)
- Protocols for external dependencies

**Application Layer** (`src/application/`)
- Orchestrator for dashboard data
- Business case calculator
- Use cases for specific workflows

**Infrastructure Layer** (`src/infrastructure/`)
- API gateways (AWS, ElectricityMaps, Boavizta)
- Cache repository

**Presentation Layer** (`src/presentation/`)
- Streamlit dashboard with three pages
- Reusable UI components

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd CarbonAware_FinOps_Local
make setup

# Start dashboard
make dashboard
# Browser: http://localhost:8501

# Run tests
make test
```

## AWS Integration (Optional)

```bash
# Configure AWS SSO
aws configure sso --profile your-profile-name
aws sso login --profile your-profile-name

# Create .env file
cp .env.example .env
# Add ELECTRICITYMAP_API_KEY to .env
```

## Test Coverage
**79/79 Tests passing (100% success rate)**
- 27 Domain Calculations Tests (Power, CO‚ÇÇ, Barroso & H√∂lzle validation)
- 29 Business Case Calculator Tests (McKinsey/MIT scenarios)
- 12 Core Calculator Tests (CloudTrail accuracy, validation factors)
- 7 Orchestrator Tests (Use case delegation, error handling)
- 4 Constants Tests (Academic values validation)

**Test Quality:**
- ‚úÖ Academic literature references in test docstrings
- ‚úÖ Edge case coverage (None, zero, negative values)
- ‚úÖ Integration tests for full data pipeline
- ‚úÖ Execution time: <3 seconds (fast feedback loop)
