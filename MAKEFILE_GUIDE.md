## üö® Important Notes

### **Before Running Destructive Commands**

**`make reset`:**
- Removes ALL local project state
- Virtual environment will be deleted
- All caches and artifacts will be removed

**`make destroy`:**
- Permanently deletes AWS infrastructure
- Cannot be undone
- Make sure you have backups

**`make cleanup-all`:**
- Permanently deletes ALL project AWS resources
- Will save ~$40-45/month in AWS costs
- Only removes resources tagged with the project

### **AWS Costs**
Current infrastructure deployment creates:
- **EC2 Instances**: ~$30/month (4x t3.micro)
- **Lambda Functions**: ~$0.50/month
- **DynamoDB**: ~$1/month
- **S3 + CloudWatch**: ~$3/month
- **Total**: ~$35/month

### **Configuration**
- **AWS Profile**: `carbon-finops-sandbox` (configurable in Makefile)
- **Region**: `eu-central-1` (configurable in Makefile)
- **Python**: Requires Python 3.9+

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues & Solutions**

**"Virtual environment not found"**
```bash
make setup  # Creates new virtual environment
```

**"AWS connectivity failed"**
```bash
aws configure --profile carbon-finops-sandbox
```

**"Terraform initialization failed"**
```bash
make clean
make deploy
```

**"Tests failing"**
```bash
make test  # Check specific failures and fix reported issues
```

**"High AWS costs"**
```bash
make cleanup-all  # Type 'CLEANUP' when prompted (saves $40+/month)
```

**"Infrastructure stuck during destroy"**
```bash
# Some AWS resources (like EventBridge rules) may need manual cleanup
# Check AWS console and manually delete stuck resources
```

## üìö Additional Resources

- **Show all commands**: `make help`
- **AWS Console**: Monitor resources and costs
- **Dashboard**: http://localhost:8050 (after `make dashboard`)
- **Log Files**: `logs/` directory (after operations)
- **Data Files**: `data/baseline/` and `data/results/`

## üéâ Success Indicators

You know everything is working when:
- ‚úÖ `make setup` completes without errors
- ‚úÖ `make test` shows all quality checks passing  
- ‚úÖ `make deploy` successfully creates 40+ AWS resources
- ‚úÖ `make status` shows infrastructure as deployed
